New Change: Random equipment drops.
 
Now when you kill a mobile, you will likely get a piece of gear.
Even if you don't see it equipped to them or in their inventory, every mobile
now has a chance to drop a totally randomized piece of gear and each piece
is unique, but not all of them are beneficial.
 
Each piece is of four different rarities:
-Mastercrafted. This is the best, and adds significant value
-Plain. This will have no special prefix, it's just plain.
-Heavily-used. This is lesser quality, lesser value.
-Cursed. This is worst quality, lowest value, and often comes with a nasty drawback.
 
Each piece also has a chance to have a random enchantment:
-Various spells. These are permanent spell effects such as flight, regeneration, haste, sanctuary etc
-Lesser bonuses. These are +1 to stats, +5 to hp, mana, move, -1 to saves, etc
-Regular bonuses. These are +2 to stats, +10 to hp, mana, move, and -2 to saves, etc
-Greater bonuses. These are +3 to stats, +20 to hp, mana, move, and -5 to saves, etc.
They also come in negative versions as well, such as vulnerability to fire, cold, lighting, etc
as well as negative stats, hp, mana, move, etc. 
 
Example: Mastercrafted Ring of Greater Nimbleness - This would have an increased value, and add +3 dex as ell as other bonuses.
Cursed Armor of Sensitivity to Light - This would have a negative effect, be worth the least money, as well as add vulnerability to light dmg.

Subject some changes~
Text
Changes: Level requirements for using weapons and armor are removed.
They will be replaced with stat requirements, though. For example
if you have a low Strength score, you will not be able to wield a 
heavy weapon in your off-hand.
 
Additionally, the weight requirement of your off-hand weapon needing to be lighter than
your primary has been removed. That has never made sense to me as the
most proficient two-handed fighters often use weapons that are equal in
weight and balance.
 
Age command added. 
This command will show your age in MARS time, actual hours played, and 
your number of logins.

The age command has been changed to 'played', to make it more in line
with modern MMORPG games and their similar commands for checking how
much time you've put into an individual character.
